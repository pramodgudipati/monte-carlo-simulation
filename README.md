# Monte Carlo Simulation

This is a statistical technique that uses pseudo-random uniform variables for a given statistical distribution based on past risk (SD) and return (mean) to predict outcomes over future time periods.

Create different portfolios and make investment return predictions after a period of time using Monte Carlo simulations. 

Default Test case "TestMoneCarloSimualtion" creates two portfolios, Aggressive and Very Conservative
and runs the simulation to predict the investment return after 20 years. Test case can be modified to make predicitons for different portfolio types,
investment periods etc.,
